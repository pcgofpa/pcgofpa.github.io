        <h2>Fence Calculator</h2>
        <p>As part of my Bachelorâ€™s degree, I built a fence material calculator. The project idea was a request from a buddy who does construction and wanted to be able to simply put the 
            dimensions of the property in and have the application calculate the required materials. 
            <br><br>
            Initially he had asked for a computer application that he could have installed, instead I pitched the idea of building it for Android so that he could carry it with him instead of 
            having to wait until he got back to the office. <br><br>
